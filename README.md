# Scrawl Backlog
The managed backlog for Scrawl by fluentCODE

We are making our backlog public here to make it easier to get user feedback on new/upcoming issues. **Please do not submit issues directly to this repo**. Create an Issue on https://github.com/fluentCODE/ScrawlIssues and if we accept it as a future feature we will enter it into the backlog.

For more information on Scrawl, checkout our website at [https://fluentco.de/](https://fluentco.de) and sign up for our mailing list.
